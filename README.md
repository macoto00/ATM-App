# ATM Demo project

The task is to design and develop an application for ATM operation. Limit the scope to a single scenario, for example, cash withdrawal.

Elaborate and research the details based on own considerations. However, ensure the realistic functionality of the ATM.

Development Task:

The application should be:

1) Built using technologies based on own preferences.

2) Constructed using a microservices architecture, specifically consisting of a frontend service (referred to as FE) and a data service (referred to as BE).

3) Utilize a REST API between FE and BE, defined using the OpenAPI Specification in the latest version.

# Description of the Development process

## Backend

Using Java, Spring Boot, Gradle, Application Variables, MySQL Database.

Using GIT and GitHub as version controll system. Specifically GitHub Desktop && || Command line Commands. 

BE was tested using Postman.

## Frontend

Thinking about using Angular Framework or just create HTML, CSS, JS in static folder for faster development. I will see later.
